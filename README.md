            <p>Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now...</p>
            
            <p>Running an SEO agency, burning through client budgets with traditional tactics that used to work but suddenly... didn't.</p>
            
            <p>Client after client was asking the same question: <span class="italic">"Why aren't we ranking anymore?"</span></p>
            
            <p>Google had changed. Their algorithms got smarter. They started understanding context, intent, and meaning in ways that made old-school keyword stuffing look like stone-age tactics.</p>
            
            <p>That's when I discovered something that changed everything...</p>

            <p>The same artificial intelligence Google uses to understand web pages... I could use it to create content that speaks Google's language fluently.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of guessing what Google wanted, I could <span class="italic">ask Google directly</span> through their own AI system.</p>
            
            <p>The results were immediate. Clients who were stuck on page 2 shot to position #1 within weeks. Local service businesses started generating so many leads they had to hire more staff.</p>

            <h2>Introducing RankExpand: SEO That Actually Works in 2025</h2>
            
            <p>Finally, an SEO solution built for the way Google <span class="italic">actually</span> works today...</p>
            
            <p>Not the way it worked in 2015. Not the way other agencies wish it worked. The way it works <span class="bold">right now</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what you get when you work with RankExpand:</p>
            
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li><span class="bold">Semantic Analysis Tool powered by Google's NLP API</span> - The same AI Google uses to understand your website, now working FOR you instead of against you</li>
                <li><span class="bold">15-page comprehensive website optimization</span> - Every page strategically crafted to dominate your most profitable keywords</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Monthly high-authority backlink building</span> - Real relationships with real websites in your industry, not spam links that'll get you penalized</li>
                <li><span class="bold">AI-optimized content creation</span> - Content that reads naturally to humans but speaks fluent Google to algorithms</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Real-time ranking tracking and reporting</span> - Watch your competitors disappear in your rearview mirror</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>But here's what makes this different from every other SEO service you've seen...</p>
            
            <p>Instead of generic strategies that might work for anyone, this is <span class="highlight">laser-targeted for niche service businesses</span> and e-commerce sellers.</p>
            
            <p>We know your customers don't just search for "plumber"... they search for "emergency plumber near me at 2am."</p>
            
            <p>We know your success depends on local dominance, not national awareness.</p>
            
            <p>And we know you need leads <span class="italic">this month</span>, not next year.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Q: "This sounds expensive. What if I can't afford it?"</div>
                <p>Here's the reality: You can't afford NOT to do this. Every month you stay invisible on Google costs you thousands in lost revenue. One new customer typically pays for several months of our service. Plus, we start with a FREE audit so you can see the opportunity before investing a penny.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "How do I know this isn't just another SEO gimmick?"</div>
                <p>Because we're using Google's own technology. This isn't some black-hat trick or temporary loophole. We're literally using the same AI Google uses to understand websites. It's like having Google's algorithm tell you exactly what it wants to see.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "I've been burned by SEO agencies before. How is this different?"</div>
                <p>Most agencies use outdated tactics from 2015. We use Google's 2025 technology. Most agencies give you generic strategies. We specialize exclusively in niche service businesses. Most agencies lock you into long contracts. We prove our value first with results, then earn your continued business.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "What if this doesn't work for my specific business?"</div>
                <p>Our Semantic Analysis Tool works for ANY business that wants to be found online. Whether you're an HVAC contractor, e-commerce seller, or professional service provider, Google's algorithm works the same way. We just adapt the strategy to your specific market and keywords.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "How long before I see results?"</div>
                <p>Most clients see ranking improvements within 4-6 weeks. Significant traffic increases typically happen within 90 days. But here's what's important: Every day you wait, your competitors get stronger. The best time to start was last year. The second best time is today.</p>
